## Importance of JavaScript

JavaScript is essential in web development for creating interactive and dynamic web pages, enhancing user experience by enabling functionalities like real-time updates, animations, and form validations. Its widespread support across all browsers and its integration with HTML and CSS make it a cornerstone technology for modern web development.

### Basic Syntax

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>JavaScript Introduction</title>
    <script>
        // JavaScript code can go here
        console.log("Hello, World!");
    </script>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>
```

If external file:

```html
<script src="script.js"></script>
```

### Variables

Declaring variables using `var`, `let`, and `const`.

In JavaScript, variables can be declared using **`var`**, **`let`**, and **`const`**. Each has its own characteristics and scoping rules:

### `var`

- **Scope:** Function-scoped or globally-scoped if declared outside a function.
- **Hoisting:** Variables declared with **`var`** are hoisted to the top of their scope but are initialized with **`undefined`**.
- **Re-declaration:** Can be re-declared and updated within its scope.

```javascript
var x = 10;
if (true) {
    var x = 20; // same variable, scope is function or global
    console.log(x); // 20
}
console.log(x); // 20
```

### `let`

- **Scope:** Block-scoped, meaning it is only accessible within the block it is declared.
- **Hoisting:** Variables declared with **`let`** are hoisted but not initialized. Accessing them before declaration results in a **`ReferenceError`**.
- **Re-declaration:** Cannot be re-declared within the same scope but can be updated.

```javascript
let y = 10;
if (true) {
    let y = 20; // different variable, scope is block
    console.log(y); // 20
}
console.log(y); // 10
```

### `const`

- **Scope:** Block-scoped, similar to **`let`**.
- **Hoisting:** Variables declared with **`const`** are hoisted but not initialized. Accessing them before declaration results in a **`ReferenceError`**.
- **Re-declaration and Updates:** Cannot be re-declared or updated. The value must be assigned at the time of declaration. However, if the variable holds an object, the object's properties can be modified.

```javascript
const z = 10;
if (true) {
    const z = 20; // different variable, scope is block
    console.log(z); // 20
}
console.log(z); // 10

const obj = {a: 1};
obj.a = 2; // Allowed, because properties of objects can be modified
console.log(obj.a); // 2
```

### Summary

- **`var`:** Function-scoped, hoisted, can be re-declared and updated.
- **`let`:** Block-scoped, hoisted (but not initialized), cannot be re-declared, can be updated.
- **`const`:** Block-scoped, hoisted (but not initialized), cannot be re-declared or updated, but properties of objects it holds can be modified.

### Data Types

JavaScript has several data types, including **`String`**, **`Number`**, **`Boolean`**, **`Undefined`**, and **`Null`**. Here's a brief overview of each:

### **String**

- **Description:** Represents textual data.
- **Example:**

```javascript
let name = "Alice";
let greeting = 'Hello, world!';
let sentence = `This is a sentence with a variable: ${name}`;
```

### **Number**

- **Description:** Represents both integer and floating-point numbers.
- **Example:**

```javascript
let age = 25;
let price = 19.99;
let infinity = Infinity;
let nan = NaN; // "Not-a-Number"
```

### **Boolean**

- **Description:** Represents logical entities, having two values: **`true`** and **`false`**.
- **Example:**

```javascript
let isActive = true;
let isCompleted = false;
```

### **Undefined**

- **Description:** A variable that has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value.
- **Example:**

```javascript
let uninitializedVar;
console.log(uninitializedVar); // undefined
```

### **Null**

- **Description:** Represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is often used to indicate that a variable should be empty.
- **Example:**

```javascript
let emptyValue = null;
console.log(emptyValue); // null
```

### **Summary of Basic Data Types**

- **String:** Textual data, enclosed in quotes (**`"`**, **`'`**, or **```**).
- **Number:** Numeric data, including integers and floats.
- **Boolean:** Logical true/false values.
- **Undefined:** A declared variable with no assigned value.
- **Null:** Explicitly denotes a nullified variable.
